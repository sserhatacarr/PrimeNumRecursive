# Prime Number Checker

This Java program allows the user to input numbers and checks whether each number is prime or not. It employs a recursive method to perform the primality check.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a number when prompted.
3. The program will determine if the number is prime or not.
4. To exit, input a negative number.

## How It Works

The program checks the primality of a given number using a recursive approach. It divides the number by decreasing divisors and determines if it's a prime number.

## Example

Suppose the user enters `17`. The program will determine that `17` is a prime number.
